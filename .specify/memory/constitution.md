# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Research Paper Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through Documentation
All technical claims, workflows, and system descriptions in the research paper must be accurate and verifiable through primary sources and documented methodologies. Every statement about robotics/AI systems, especially ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems, must be grounded in verifiable implementation details or peer-reviewed research.

### Clarity for Academic Readers
The research paper must maintain clarity for readers with Computer Science and Robotics backgrounds. Technical concepts, algorithms, and system architectures must be presented with appropriate detail and context to enable understanding by peers in the field. Language should be precise, avoiding jargon without proper definition.

### Reproducibility of Technical Claims
All technical claims, experimental results, and system descriptions must be reproducible. This includes providing sufficient detail about configurations, parameters, software versions, and implementation steps so that other researchers can replicate the findings or build upon the work. Code snippets, if included, must be complete and accurate.

### Rigor in Source Material
All research must be based on peer-reviewed robotics, AI, or HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) sources. When citing previous work, prefer publications from recognized conferences and journals in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer science. Anecdotal or non-peer-reviewed sources should only be used when explicitly noted as such and for specific purposes.

## Key Standards

### Source Tracing
All claims made in the research paper must be source-traceable. Every technical assertion, experimental result, and theoretical concept must be backed by a verifiable source or clearly indicated as original work with appropriate methodology described.

### Citation Format
All references must follow APA citation style consistently throughout the document. This applies to all source types: peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, technical documentation, software repositories, and other academic materials.

### Source Quality Requirements
At least 50% of the sources cited in the research paper must be peer-reviewed articles or conference papers from recognized venues in robotics, AI, or related fields. The remaining sources should be high-quality technical documentation, official software documentation, or other scholarly works.

### Plagiarism Standards
The research paper must maintain 0% tolerance for plagiarism. All borrowed content must be properly cited and attributed. All content must be original unless explicitly attributed to other sources. The final document must pass plagiarism detection software.

### Writing Clarity Standards
The research paper must maintain a Flesch-Kincaid grade level between 11-13 to ensure it is accessible to the target academic audience while maintaining the technical depth required for a robotics research paper.

## Technical Coverage Requirements

### ROS 2 Systems Coverage
The research paper must provide comprehensive coverage of ROS 2 concepts including nodes, topics, URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), and rclpy implementation details. All ROS 2 components mentioned must be accurately described with proper context for how they apply to the research.

### Simulation Frameworks Coverage
The paper must include detailed coverage of both Gazebo and Unity simulation environments, including their physics engines, sensor simulation capabilities, and rendering systems. The comparison between these platforms must be accurate and comprehensive.

### NVIDIA Isaac Coverage
All references to NVIDIA Isaac must accurately describe its perception, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and navigation capabilities as they apply to the research context. Technical details must be precise and implementation-focused.

### Vision-Language-Action Systems
The research paper must accurately detail the integration of Whisper and LLM planning in Vision-Language-Action systems. The pipeline from voice input to plan generation must be thoroughly explained with technical precision.

### Capstone Pipeline
The complete pipeline from "voice → plan → navigate → detect → manipulate" must be described in technical detail, showing how each component integrates with the others to form a complete system. Implementation details must be accurate and verifiable.

## Success Criteria

### Claim Verification
All claims made in the research paper must be independently verified either through citation of authoritative sources, description of reproducible experimental methodology, or clear indication of theoretical assertions.

### Plagiarism Compliance
The research paper must pass plagiarism detection with 0% unattributed content. All borrowed concepts, text, and ideas must be properly attributed to their original sources.

### Technical Fact-Checking
The research paper must pass technical fact-checking review by domain experts, confirming that all technical information is accurate and properly represented.

## Governance
This constitution defines the mandatory standards for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics research paper project. All content, code examples, citations, and technical descriptions must comply with these principles. Any deviation from these principles must be explicitly justified and documented.

Amendments to this constitution require formal documentation of the change, its rationale, and impact on existing work. All project contributors must acknowledge and agree to these principles before contributing to the research paper.
