# Research Paper Specification: [PAPER TITLE]

**Paper Branch**: `[###-paper-title]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Research Scenarios & Validation *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Research topics should be PRIORITIZED as academic inquiry areas ordered by importance.
  Each research topic must be INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATABLE - meaning if you complete just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable research contribution that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each topic, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each topic as a standalone research area that can be:
  - Researched independently
  - Validated independently
  - Verified independently
  - Demonstrated to academic peers independently
-->

### Research Topic 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this research area in academic terms]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the significance and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently - e.g., "Can be fully validated by [specific methodology] and provides [specific contribution]"]

**Validation Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [research context], **When** [methodology applied], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [research context], **When** [methodology applied], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Research Topic 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this research area in academic terms]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the significance and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Validation Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [research context], **When** [methodology applied], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Research Topic 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this research area in academic terms]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the significance and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Validation Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [research context], **When** [methodology applied], **Then** [expected outcome]

[Add more research topics as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- How does the research handle [boundary condition]?
- What about [special scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right research requirements.
-->

### Research Requirements

- **RR-001**: Research paper MUST provide source-traceable technical claims according to constitution principles
- **RR-002**: Research paper MUST maintain academic clarity for CS/Robotics readers
- **RR-003**: Research paper MUST enable reproducibility of all technical claims and workflows
- **RR-004**: Research paper MUST use peer-reviewed sources for at least 50% of citations
- **RR-005**: Research paper MUST follow APA citation format consistently

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **RR-006**: Research MUST be based on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific methodology not specified]
- **RR-007**: Research MUST validate technical claims using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validation method not specified]

### Key Concepts *(include if research involves core ideas)*

- **[Concept 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Concept 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other concepts]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable academic success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Academic metric, e.g., "All technical claims are verifiable through source-traceable methodology"]
- **SC-002**: [Quality metric, e.g., "Paper maintains Flesch-Kincaid grade level between 11-13"]
- **SC-003**: [Citation metric, e.g., "At least 50% of sources are peer-reviewed articles or conference papers"]
- **SC-004**: [Plagiarism metric, e.g., "Paper passes plagiarism check with 0% unattributed content"]
