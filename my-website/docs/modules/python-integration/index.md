# Python Integration

This module covers using the rclpy Python client library to create ROS 2 nodes and bridge AI agents with robot controllers. This covers writing nodes in Python and integrating AI components with robot control systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Use the rclpy Python client library to create ROS 2 nodes
- Implement ROS communication patterns in Python
- Bridge AI agents with robot controllers
- Develop practical Python applications for robot control

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with ROS 2 concepts (from ROS 2 Foundations module)
- Understanding of nodes, topics, and services

## Lessons

This module contains two lessons:

1. **Lesson 1: Writing ROS 2 Nodes in Python** - Creating nodes using rclpy
2. **Lesson 2: Bridging AI and Robot Controllers** - Connecting AI systems to robot control

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 2-3 hours
