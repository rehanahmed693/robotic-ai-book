# ROS 2 Foundations

This module covers the foundational concepts of ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robot control, focusing on architecture and core communication patterns (nodes, topics, services). Students will understand how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" connecting different robot components.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and its role in robotics
- Implement basic publisher/subscriber communication patterns
- Create and use services for request/response interactions
- Appreciate how ROS 2 enables modular robot software design

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts

## Lessons

This module contains two lessons:

1. **Lesson 1: Architecture** - Understanding the ROS 2 middleware architecture
2. **Lesson 2: Nodes, Topics, and Services** - Core communication patterns in ROS 2

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 2-3 hours
