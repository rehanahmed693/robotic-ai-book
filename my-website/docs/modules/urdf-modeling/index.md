# URDF Modeling

This module covers understanding and creating URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files to model humanoid robots, including joint definitions and kinematic chains. This covers the structure of URDF files and how to build basic humanoid models.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the structure and components of URDF files
- Create basic robot models with links and joints
- Define joint properties and constraints for humanoid robots
- Validate URDF files using ROS tools

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (from ROS 2 Foundations module)
- Basic knowledge of XML syntax

## Lessons

This module contains two lessons:

1. **Lesson 1: URDF Structure and Joint Definitions** - Understanding URDF components
2. **Lesson 2: Building a Basic Humanoid Model** - Creating a complete humanoid robot model

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 2-3 hours
