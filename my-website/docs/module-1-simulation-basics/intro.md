# Module 1: Simulation Basics

Welcome to the Simulation Basics module! This module introduces you to the fundamental concepts of physics simulation in robotics, focusing on how physical properties like gravity and collisions are modeled in simulation environments.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, we'll cover the essential physics concepts that form the foundation of robotic simulations. You'll learn how to:

- Model physical properties like gravity in simulation environments
- Understand collision detection and response mechanisms
- Apply these concepts using Gazebo simulation tools

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with computer simulation concepts
- Access to a computer capable of running Gazebo simulation environment

## Learning Path

This module consists of two chapters that build upon each other:

1. **Chapter 1: Physics Concepts** - Understanding fundamental physics properties in simulation
2. **Chapter 2: Gravity and Collisions** - Exploring how gravity and collisions are modeled

Let's begin by exploring the fundamental physics concepts that govern robotic simulations!
