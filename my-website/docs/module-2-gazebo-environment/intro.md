# Module 2: World/Environment Setup in Gazebo

In this module, you will learn how to create and configure simulation environments in Gazebo, a powerful 3D simulation environment for robotics applications. You'll explore the tools and concepts needed to build effective simulation worlds for robotic testing and development.

## What You'll Learn

This module will teach you essential skills for:

- Creating custom simulation worlds in Gazebo
- Configuring environment properties and materials
- Adding models and objects to your simulation
- Optimizing environments for performance

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:

- Module 1: Simulation Basics
- Basic familiarity with Gazebo interface

## Learning Path

This module consists of one chapter that builds practical skills:

1. **Chapter 1: World Construction** - Building custom environments from scratch

Let's begin creating your first Gazebo world!
