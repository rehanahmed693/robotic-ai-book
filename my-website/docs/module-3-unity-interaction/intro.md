# Module 3: Unity Interaction

This module focuses on using Unity for high-fidelity visual rendering and human-robot interaction in digital twin simulations. You'll learn how Unity can complement physics-based simulation environments like Gazebo with realistic visualization.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

- Unity's visualization capabilities for robotics
- Techniques for high-fidelity rendering
- Human-robot interaction mechanisms
- Integration concepts between simulation and visualization

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- Basic familiarity with Unity interface
- Understanding of 3D graphics concepts

## Learning Path

This module consists of one chapter focusing on visualization:

1. **Chapter 1: Rendering and Interaction** - High-fidelity rendering and user interaction

Let's begin exploring Unity's visualization capabilities for robotics!
