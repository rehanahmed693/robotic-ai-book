# Module 4: Sensor Simulation

This module focuses on simulating core sensors used in robotics: LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs. You'll learn how to generate realistic sensor data with appropriate noise models, which is essential for developing perception and navigation algorithms.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

- LiDAR sensor simulation and data generation
- Depth camera modeling and point cloud generation
- IMU simulation with realistic noise characteristics
- Noise modeling techniques for sensor data

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed previous modules
- Understanding of basic sensor principles
- Familiarity with ROS (Robot Operating System) concepts

## Learning Path

This module consists of three chapters covering different sensor types:

1. **Chapter 1: LiDAR Simulation** - Modeling LiDAR sensors and point cloud data
2. **Chapter 2: Depth Camera Simulation** - Working with depth sensors and RGB-D data
3. **Chapter 3: IMU and Noise Modeling** - Simulating inertial measurement units with noise

Let's begin exploring sensor simulation in robotics!
