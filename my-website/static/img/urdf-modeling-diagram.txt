# URDF Modeling Diagram

This text file describes the structure of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid robots.

## Basic Structure:

robot (root)
├── link: base_link
│   ├── visual: shape, color, material
│   ├── collision: collision geometry
│   └── inertial: mass, center of mass, inertia tensor
├── joint: connects links
│   ├── parent: parent link name
│   ├── child: child link name
│   ├── type: joint type (revolute, continuous, prismatic, fixed, etc.)
│   ├── origin: position and orientation of joint relative to parent
│   ├── axis: joint axis of rotation or translation
│   └── limit: joint limits (for revolute and prismatic joints)
└── materials: color definitions

## Humanoid Robot Structure:

       neck_joint (revolute)
          |
        torso (base_link)
       /           \
shoulder_joint    shoulder_joint
      |               |
   upper_arm       upper_arm
      |               |
  elbow_joint     elbow_joint
      |               |
   lower_arm       lower_arm
      |               |
  wrist_joint     wrist_joint
      |               |

## Key Concepts:

1. Links: Rigid bodies of the robot
2. Joints: Connections between links
3. Kinematic Chains: Sequences of links and joints for limbs
4. Coordinate Systems: Each link has its own coordinate frame
