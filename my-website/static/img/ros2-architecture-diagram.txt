# ROS 2 Architecture Diagram

This text file describes the key components of the ROS 2 architecture.

## Core Components:

[Node A] --publishes--> [Topic] <--subscribes-- [Node B]
                    |
                    v
             [DDS Middleware (e.g., FastDDS)]
                    |
                    v
[Service Client] <--request/response--> [Service Server]

## Communication Patterns:

1. Publisher/Subscriber (Topics)
   - Asynchronous, one-to-many or many-to-many communication
   - Data flows from publishers to subscribers on named topics

2. Client/Server (Services)
   - Synchronous, one-to-one communication
   - Request/response pattern for specific operations

3. Action Client/Server (Actions)
   - For long-running operations
   - Supports goals, feedback, and results
