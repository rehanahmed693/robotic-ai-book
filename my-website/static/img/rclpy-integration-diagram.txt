# rclpy Integration Diagram

This text file describes how AI systems integrate with robot controllers via ROS 2 and rclpy.

## Architecture:

[Physical Robot]

## Key Components:

1. AI Decision System: Makes decisions based on data
2. rclpy Node: Python node implementing the AI logic
3. ROS 2 Communication: Topics, services for message passing
4. Robot Controllers: Handle low-level robot commands

## Communication Flow:

AI System -> rclpy Node -> ROS Topics -> Robot Controllers -> Robot Actions
