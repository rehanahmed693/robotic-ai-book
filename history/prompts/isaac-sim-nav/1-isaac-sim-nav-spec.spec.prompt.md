## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

I'll help you create a feature specification based on your description about the AI-Robot Brain with NVIDIA Isaac. Let me start by creating a todo list to track this process.

[Full response containing the specification for "The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)" covering Isaac Sim basics, Perception & VSLAM using Isaac ROS, Nav2 Path Planning, and Humanoid Movement Integration]

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created comprehensive specification for NVIDIA Isaac educational content
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validated against quality checklist with all items passing
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist in specs/001-isaac-sim-nav directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan or /sp.clarify to continue development
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification covers all required topics with measurable success criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All validation criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify command
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase with /sp.plan
