  Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Target: Learners studying LLM-robotics integration. Focus: Voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-based planning, and full VLA autonomy. Chapters (3–4 lessons): Foundations of VLA Systems – LLM–robot convergence, action grounding. Voice-to-Action – Whisper-based command capture → intent parsing. Cognitive Planning with LLMs – Converting natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid – Voice command → plan → navigation → object detection → manipulation. Success criteria: Clear explanation of VLA pipeline, grounded examples, accurate ROS/LLM integration flow. Constraints: Concise, APA-style Markdown; no vendor comparisons or full implementation code.

  Created a comprehensive specification for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems for Robotics educational module. The specification includes:

  1. User Scenarios & Testing:
     - Primary scenario: Learning LLM-robotics integration
     - Secondary scenario: Voice-to-Action pipeline
     - Capstone scenario: Autonomous humanoid control

  2. Functional Requirements:
     - Clear explanations of VLA systems
     - Lessons on LLM-robot convergence and action grounding
     - Voice command capture and intent parsing
     - Cognitive planning with LLMs
     - Capstone project integration
     - Grounded examples of ROS-LLM integration
     - APA-style Markdown formatting
     - No vendor comparisons or implementation code

  3. Non-functional Requirements:
     - Accessibility for learners with basic robotics knowledge
     - Hands-on exercises
     - Measurable learning outcomes
     - Assessment materials

  4. Key Concepts:
     - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
     - Action Grounding
     - Cognitive Planning with LLMs
     - Voice-to-Action Pipeline
     - LLM-robotics Integration

  5. Success Criteria:
     - 80% of learners can explain VLA pipeline
     - 90% accuracy in voice-command-to-robot-action conversion
     - 90% can convert natural language to ROS 2 action sequences
     - 4.0/5.0 satisfaction rating
     - Completion within 15-20 hours

  The specification also includes a quality checklist that validates all requirements are met.
outcome: |-
  The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase. It provides a clear roadmap for developing the Vision-Language-Action educational module, with measurable success criteria and well-defined user scenarios.
evaluation: |
  The specification successfully captures the requirements for the VLA educational module. All mandatory sections are completed, requirements are testable, and success criteria are measurable. The specification is ready to move to the planning phase.
