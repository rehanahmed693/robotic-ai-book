  AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation (Docusaurus)
  Create: architecture sketch, section structure, research method, and quality checks.
  Document key decisions: options, tradeoffs, and rationale.
  Define testing: validation steps aligned with acceptance criteria.

  Technical details:

  Use research-concurrent workflow

  Apply APA citation style (per Constitution)

  Structure work in phases: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis
response_text: |
  Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems for Robotics educational module. The planning included:

  1. Technical Context:
     - APA-style Markdown with Docusaurus documentation system
     - Docusaurus framework, React components, Node.js environment
     - Git-based version control with Markdown files
     - Academic peer review and accessibility validation
     - Web-based platform for accessibility

  2. Research Phase (research.md):
     - VLA architecture patterns and current research
     - Whisper-based voice processing implementation
     - LLM integration for cognitive planning
     - ROS 2 integration patterns
     - Capstone project research foundations

  3. Design Phase (data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/):
     - Defined key educational entities and relationships
     - Created quickstart guide for educators and learners
     - Established educational content contract with structure and requirements
     - Updated agent context with new technology information

  4. Constitution Check:
     - All requirements satisfied, with compliance verification for each principle
     - Source-traceable technical claims
     - APA-style citations with peer-reviewed sources
     - Academic clarity and readability standards (Flesch-Kincaid grade 11-13)
     - Coverage of required topics including Vision-Language-Action systems

  The plan is now ready for the next phase: task breakdown and implementation.
outcome: |-
  The implementation plan for the VLA Systems educational module is complete and comprehensive. It includes all required components: technical context, research, data model, quickstart guide, and educational contracts. All constitution requirements have been validated and addressed. The plan is ready for task breakdown and implementation.
evaluation: |
  The planning phase was executed successfully, creating all required artifacts and satisfying all constitution requirements. The research is comprehensive, the data model appropriately represents educational concepts, and the contracts establish clear standards for content creation. The plan aligns with the phased approach requested: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis.
