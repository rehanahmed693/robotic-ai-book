  /sp.implement You have a folder named my-website implement all things in the folder and also updated it.
response_text: |
  Successfully completed the implementation of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems educational module in the my-website folder. The implementation included:

  1. Created the VLA Systems module directory structure
  2. Added all required educational content files:
     - Introduction document (intro.md)
     - Resources page with APA citations (resources.md)
     - Chapter 1: Foundations of VLA Systems (chapter-1-foundations.md)
     - Chapter 2: Voice-to-Action Pipeline (chapter-2-voice-action.md)
     - Chapter 3: Cognitive Planning with LLMs (chapter-3-cognitive-planning.md)
     - Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Control (capstone-project.md)
     - Lesson template documentation (lesson-template.md)
  3. Updated the sidebars.ts file to include navigation for the new VLA Systems module
  4. All content follows the standard lesson template with LearningObjectives, DurationEstimator, and KeyTakeaways components
  5. All content includes knowledge checks and assessments as appropriate
  6. Content is structured to align with the original specification requirements:
     - Voice command processing using Whisper-based systems
     - Cognitive planning with LLMs for converting natural language to ROS 2 action sequences
     - Complete voice → plan → navigation → detection → manipulation pipeline
     - Focus on educational delivery with proper learning objectives and assessments

  The implementation satisfies all requirements from the original specification and maintains the high educational standards required for the robotics curriculum.
outcome: |-
  The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems module has been successfully implemented in the my-website educational platform. All content is in place and properly integrated with the navigation system.
evaluation: |
  The implementation successfully delivers on the original requirements to create an educational module on VLA systems for robotics. The content is well-structured, follows educational best practices, and includes all required components from the specification. The integration with the existing my-website platform is seamless.
