# Quickstart Guide: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Educational Module

## Overview
This guide helps you set up and navigate the Digital Twin educational content focusing on Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation. The content is structured in modules, chapters, and lessons to provide a progressive learning experience.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)
- Computer capable of running Gazebo and Unity (see system requirements below)

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, or Linux
- RAM: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended)
- Processor: Quad-core processor or equivalent
- Graphics: Dedicated graphics card with 2GB+ VRAM (for optimal Unity performance)
- Storage: 10GB available space
- Internet connection for initial setup

## Getting Started

### 1. Accessing the Content
1. Navigate to the published documentation site
2. The sidebar displays the hierarchical structure: Modules → Chapters → Lessons
3. Start with Module 1: Simulation Basics to build foundational knowledge

### 2. Learning Path
1. Each module contains 1-3 chapters focused on specific aspects of digital twin simulation
2. Each chapter contains 1-2 lessons with hands-on exercises
3. Complete modules in sequence for best learning outcomes
4. Complete all exercises and assessments in each lesson before proceeding

### 3. Hands-on Practice
1. Each lesson includes practical exercises using Gazebo and Unity
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions carefully
3. Don't skip the activities - they reinforce the concepts taught
4. Try to understand the 'why' behind each step, not just the 'how'

## Content Structure
- **Module 1**: Simulation Basics (Physics, gravity, collisions)
- **Module 2**: World/Environment setup in Gazebo 
- **Module 3**: Unity Interaction (High-fidelity rendering, human-robot interaction)
- **Module 4**: Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs and noise modeling)

## Navigation Tips
- Use the left sidebar to navigate between modules and chapters
- The "Next" and "Previous" buttons at the bottom of each page guide you through lessons sequentially
- The search function helps you find specific topics across all modules
- Code snippets can be copied with the copy button in the top-right corner

## Getting Help
- If you encounter technical issues, check that your system meets the requirements
- For content-specific questions, refer to the Resources section in each lesson
- For further assistance, consult the additional resources at the end of each module

## Next Steps
After completing Module 1, you'll have a foundation in simulation basics and be ready to explore environment creation in Gazebo.
