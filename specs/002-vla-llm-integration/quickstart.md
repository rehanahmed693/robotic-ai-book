**Feature**: VLA Systems for Robotics (002-vla-llm-integration)  
**Input**: `/specs/002-vla-llm-integration/spec.md`

## Overview

This quickstart guide provides educators and learners with the essential information needed to begin working with the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems educational module. The module teaches how to integrate vision, language, and action in robotics using LLMs and voice commands.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the VLA Systems module, ensure you have:

1. **Basic Robotics Knowledge**:
   - Understanding of robot operating systems (especially ROS 2)
   - Familiarity with robotic sensors and actuators
   - Basic knowledge of navigation and manipulation concepts

2. **Programming Background**:
   - Python programming skills
   - Understanding of APIs and client-server communication
   - Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts

3. **Technical Setup**:
   - Access to the educational platform hosting the VLA module
   - Web browser compatible with the platform
   - Audio input capability for voice command exercises (optional for simulation)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access the Module

1. Navigate to the robotics education platform
2. Locate the "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems" module
3. Ensure you've completed the prerequisite modules on ROS 2 and basic robotics

### Step 2: Explore the Module Structure

The VLA module is organized into 3-4 lessons:

- **Lesson 1**: Foundations of VLA Systems - Learn about LLM-robot convergence and action grounding
- **Lesson 2**: Voice-to-Action Pipeline - Understand Whisper-based command capture and intent parsing
- **Lesson 3**: Cognitive Planning with LLMs - Convert natural language tasks into action sequences
- **Lesson 4**: Capstone Project - Implement a complete voice-commanded humanoid robot

### Step 3: Start with Foundations

Begin with Lesson 1 to understand the core concepts:
- How vision, language, and action components work together
- The role of LLMs in robotics applications
- The concept of action grounding

## Key Concepts to Focus On
